<h1 id="multi-agent-examples">Multi-agent Examples</h1>
<p>In this example I show an example of an agent that writes a story using a series of steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>The user provides an idea for their story.</li>
<li>The <code>Outline Bot</code> generates an outline for the story including section titles and descriptions.</li>
<li>The first section content is created by the <code>Story Bot</code> from section title/description and the overall story description.</li>
<li>The <code>Summary Bot</code> creates a summary of the newly generated chapter.</li>
<li>The section summary is passed to the <code>Story Bot</code> along with section title/description to generate the next section.</li>
<li>All sections follow steps 3-5.
...</li>
<li>The sections are combined into a full story.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Story bot design diagram" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/public_data_09324832787/story_bot_design.svg" /></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pydantic
import typing

import sys
sys.path.append('../src/')

import simplechatbot
from simplechatbot.openai_agent import OpenAIAgent
</code></pre>
<p>First I create a new chatbot from OpenAI using the API stored in the keychain file.</p>
<p>I also create a new function <code>stream_it</code> that prints the result from the LLM as it is received and returns the full result of the LLM call.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">keychain = simplechatbot.APIKeyChain.from_json_file('../keys.json')
base_agent = OpenAIAgent.new(
    model_name = 'gpt-4o-mini', 
    api_key=keychain['openai'],
)
</code></pre>
<p>Next we need to direct the LLM to create an outline for the story. I do this by creating a system prompt describing the task of creating an outline and a pydantic class to direct the LLM on how to structure its response. This is important because the output of the outline bot will be used for generating chapters.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class StoryOutline(pydantic.BaseModel):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Outline of the story.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    story_topic: str = pydantic.Field(description=&quot;The topic of the story.&quot;)

    part1_title: str = pydantic.Field(description=&quot;Title of Part 1 of the story.&quot;)

<pre><code>topic: Rekindling a Friendship

The Innocent Bond: In a small town, two children, Mia and Jake, form a deep bond during summer vacations. They share adventures, secrets, and dreams, making a pact to always stay friends. However, as they grow older, Mia moves away, and they lose touch. The chapter ends with Mia looking back at old photos, reminiscing about the carefree days of their friendship and wondering how Jake is doing.

A Chance Encounter: Years later, Mia returns to her hometown for a wedding. On the night of the event, she unexpectedly runs into Jake, who hasn't changed much but feels like a stranger. Their initial conversation is awkward, filled with nostalgia and uncertainty. But as the night unfolds, they find common ground in shared memories. They agree to grab coffee the next day to catch up, both feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety about seeing each other after so long.

Rebuilding the Past: During coffee, Mia and Jake navigate the complexities of their adult lives, revealing new aspects of their personalities that have developed separately. They reminisce about the past but also confront the differences that have emerged over the years. Misunderstandings arise but are resolved through open communication, leading to a rekindling of their friendship. The chapter ends with both feeling hopeful but uncertain about what the future holds for their relationship.

<pre><code>The sun-drenched days of summer blended into a tapestry of laughter and adventure for Mia and Jake. Their small town, a canvas of vibrant colors and warm breezes, became the backdrop for their blossoming friendship.

They often met at the old oak tree, its branches spreading wide like welcoming arms, where they shared whispered secrets and dreams of the future. One day, they painstakingly crafted a treasure map from an old cereal box, declaring their mission to find hidden gems in the nearby woods. With their imaginations running wild, they transformed fallen twigs into swords, prowled like pirates, and crowned each other as guardians of their secret world.

Mia would sometimes pull out her worn notebook, filled with sketches of their adventures, while Jake would recount tales of daring knights and fearless dragons. They made a pact—an earnest promise to always stay friends—each believing their bond was unbreakable.

Then, as summer slipped away and the cold winds of fate began to blow, Mia's family received the news. They were moving, a change that echoed with uncertainty and sadness. On the night before her departure, they sat under the stars, their hearts heavy with unspoken fears. Mia held Jake's hand tightly, sealing their pact with a desperate wish that distance would never come between them.

Years passed like fluttering leaves in the autumn breeze. Mia moved to a place where everything felt foreign. New friends filled her days, but the whispers of that innocent bond lingered in the corners of her heart. One quiet evening, feeling nostalgic, she rummaged through a box of memories.

As she pulled out old photographs, the vibrant summer days unfolded before her eyes. There they were, sunlight dancing off their smiles, the world their playground. She paused at a picture where they both grinned widely, remnants of mud smeared on their cheeks from a day spent crafting makeshift capes in the backyard, imaginations soaring.

Mia’s heart tightened as she wondered where Jake was now, if he recalled their pact, the whispers of their carefree laughter carried by the winds through the years. In that moment, she realized that though miles apart, the bond they forged during those innocent days still held a spark of hope, waiting to be rekindled.

<pre><code>Mia stepped out of the wedding venue, the soft glow of string lights illuminating the night as laughter and music floated through the air. She wrapped her shawl tighter around her shoulders, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the evening breeze. It was a night of joy, yet a weight settled in her chest as she navigated the familiar streets of her hometown.

Suddenly, she spotted him across the courtyard – Jake, leaning casually against a pillar, his tall frame and easy smile still as comforting as she remembered. The years melted into the background as their eyes locked, and it felt as if time had rewound to that summer when everything was simple. But beneath the familiarity lay an awkwardness; he was a stranger now, the miles between them stretching wider than she’d anticipated.

“Jake?” Mia called out, her voice barely cutting through the thrum of the festivities.

“Mia!” he responded, his surprise mirrored in his bright eyes. He stepped forward, hands shoved in his pockets. “Wow, it’s been… what? Nearly a decade?”

“Yeah, something like that.” She chuckled nervously, glancing away. “You look… well, the same.”

He laughed, a sound that tugged at her heart, but it felt different this time — tinged with a hint of uncertainty. “And you still have that same spark,” he replied, though just as quickly as the words left his mouth, his expression faltered. “How’s life been?”

They each began to share snippets of their lives, awkward pauses punctuating their conversation. The nostalgia laced their exchanges, memories of childhood adventures swirling around them. “Do you remember that treasure map we made?” Mia asked, a smile creeping onto her face.

Jake’s face lit up. “Of course. We thought we were real pirates.”

The moment drew them closer, their shared laughter echoing in the night. As they reminisced, the tension melted away, and a flicker of connection sparked anew. Their hearts raced with an unspoken agreement: they wouldn’t let this chance pass by.

“How about we grab coffee tomorrow?” Mia suggested, holding her breath as she waited for his response.

“Yeah, I’d like that,” Jake replied, his smile returning with a hint of warmth.

As they parted ways, a mix of excitement and anxiety washed over Mia. She watched him walk back into the crowd, feeling a renewed sense of hope. Perhaps this was the beginning of rekindling what they had lost, a chance to mend the spaces that distance had created.

She spotted Jake at a corner table, his back straight, absorbed in a steaming mug. Memories flooded her as she approached—of painting their childhood treehouse and sharing secrets under the stars.

“Hey,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

He looked up, his expression brightening. “Hey, you made it.”

They exchanged warm smiles, feeling the shock of re-encounter fade, replaced by a comfortable, yet cautious atmosphere. As they sipped their coffees, the conversation flowed from light-hearted banter to deeper confessions. Mia shared tales of her career struggles, and Jake spoke of unpredictable travel adventures.

“Remember the treasure map we made?” Mia chuckled, attempting to bridge any lingering gaps, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup.

Jake laughed, a sound that reminded her of so many summers spent laughing together. “Yeah, and how we never found anything but those old coins?”

A moment of silence lingered as they both realized how their paths have diverged since those days—her commitment to a steady job, his penchant for spontaneity. Tension arose as they stumbled into differences: Jake’s love for risk clashed with Mia’s yearning for stability.

“This is nice, but…” Mia hesitated, searching for the right words, “could we talk about how life has changed us?”

He nodded, looking serious for a moment. Misunderstandings emerged as they aired out old grievances—miscommunication that had haunted their friendship for years.

“I thought you were mad at me for leaving,” Jake admitted, running a hand through his hair.

“I was just scared of losing you,” Mia replied, her voice trembling slightly. They both took deep breaths, the tension easing as honesty laid the groundwork for rebuilding.

With each revelation, walls crumbled, revealing the roots of their companionship buried beneath soil and time. They embraced vulnerability, each apology serving as both an acknowledgment of the past and a guide forward.

They left the coffee shop with that same hopeful feeling—a cautious optimism decorating the edges of their hearts. As Mia turned to look at Jake one last time before parting ways, a sense of uncertainty lingered in the air. Would this be the beginning of something new, or merely a fleeting spark?

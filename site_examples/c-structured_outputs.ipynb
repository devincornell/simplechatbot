    "One of the most powerful features of LLMs is the ability to produce outputs which conform to a pre-determined structure. There are several instances in which this feature is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Output structures may enforce \"reasoning\" or systematic approaches to generating responses.\n",
    "+ The output must be passed to an application or interface that is not simply text-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define output structures using custom Pydantic types with attribute descriptions and validation logics. See more about using Pydantic types for structured outputs using langchain [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/structured_outputs/). This package builds on that functionality by making it easy to request structured output at any point in an exchange."
